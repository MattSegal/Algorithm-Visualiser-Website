# Algorithm Visualizer

[View Live Website Here](http://mattdsegal.com/sort)

### Overview
This is a single page app that displays an unsorted bar chart. The user can select and run a sorting algorithm on the chart. I decided to write this app without jQuery to see what it would be like. It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. Unfotunately it currently uses ES6 generators and requires the latest version of Chrome to run.
  
### Current Bugs
* unknown
  
### To Do - Improvements
* Make the display fit to smaller screen heights.
* Use diffing to make UI changes rather than destroying/creating whole chart every render
  
### To Do - New Features
* add more interesting sorting algorithms (QuickSort, ShellSort, StoogeSort)
