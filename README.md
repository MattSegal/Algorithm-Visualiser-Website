### Overview

This is a single page app that displays an unsorted bar chart. The user can select and run a sorting algorithm on the chart. I decided to write this app without jQuery to see what it would be like. It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. 
  
### Build


* `npm install`
* `npm run dev`
